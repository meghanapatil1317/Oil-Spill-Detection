1. Data Collection Module
Sources: Satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-1, MODIS, RADARSAT), drones, and surveillance footage.

Formats: Optical images, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), multispectral/hyperspectral data.

Preprocessing: Remove noise, normalize images, convert raw images into usable formats.

2. Image Preprocessing Module
Noise Reduction: Use filters (Gaussian, Median) to remove unwanted noise.

Edge Detection: Apply Canny or Sobel filters to highlight oil spill boundaries.

Contrast Enhancement: Histogram equalization to improve visibility.

Segmentation: Convert images to grayscale/binary to isolate oil spill areas.

3. Feature Extraction Module
Texture Analysis: Extract features like GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) for surface texture differences.

Color Features: Identify dark spills against lighter water surfaces.

SAR Signature Analysis: Analyze backscatter values for oil-water distinction.

4. Machine Learning/Deep Learning Module
Model Selection:

Traditional ML: Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Trees.

Deep Learning: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), U-Net for segmentation, YOLO for real-time detection.

Training & Validation:

Train models using labeled oil spill datasets.

Apply data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.

Use cross-validation to evaluate performance.

5. Real-Time Detection & Alert Module
Integration with IoT/Drones: Connect real-time cameras or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).

Automated Alerts: Generate alerts using APIs when an oil spill is detected.

Dashboard Visualization: Use GIS tools or web applications for live tracking.

6. Deployment & Monitoring Module
Cloud Deployment: Host on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

Edge Computing: Deploy lightweight models on embedded systems for on-site detection.

Model Updating: Continuous learning with new data to improve detection accuracy.

7. Reporting & Analytics Module
Report Generation: Automate periodic reports on detected spills.

Data Logging: Maintain historical records for trend analysis.

Compliance & Regulations: Ensure adherence to environmental laws.
