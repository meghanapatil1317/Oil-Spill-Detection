        Oil Spill Detection Using Machine Learning
Objective: Detect oil spills using AIS data and SAR-2 satellite imagery.
Motivation: Oil spills cause major ecological damage—early detection is critical.
Phase 1 – AIS-Based Anomaly Detection
•	Inputs: Latitude, Longitude, SOG, COG, Heading.
•	Process: Anomaly detection using motion profiling.
•	Clustering: DBSCAN used to localize suspicious maritime behaviour.
Phase 2 – SAR-2 Image Analysis
•	Data: SAR-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images.
•	Advantage: Works in all weather, clear oil slick visualization.
•	Technique: Image processing & deep learning used to detect spills.
Final Output & Impact
•	Fusion: AIS + SAR data for accurate, cross-validated oil spill detection.
•	Applications:
o	Real-time maritime monitoring.
o	Environmental protection.
o	Support for marine agencies.
